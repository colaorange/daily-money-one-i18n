`Daily Money` is an open-source, free, and ad-free Android smartphone accounting software originating from 2011. It underwent a revamp in 2018, rebranded as `Daily Money+`, to align with the new Android system at that time while still adhering to the principles of being free and ad-free.

From the initial version in 2011 to the revamped version in 2018, the software was developed during the author's spare time when switching jobs. Due to time, resource constraints, and health conditions, insufficient effort was invested in subsequent program maintenance or community management. Eventually, due to the author's busy full-time job, the software was completely ignored.

Although the author didn't spend much time maintaining the software and community, the author still uses the self-developed software for accounting every day. However, as time passes, the software gradually falls behind system updates, and some features cannot run on new smartphones. The author began to worry that one day the software would cease to function, and the ten years of records would be lost.

## Crisis as an Opportunity

In a nutshell, the author was laid off by the company at the end of 2023. 

Facing the situation where the entire department was laid off, regardless of performance or capability, left the author extremely disheartened. After months of silence and being middle-aged without connections, finding a good job was not easy. Realizing that focusing on self-programming development to directly serve users might be a more meaningful choice than toil for others.

Therefore, the author returned and decided to focus on running his independent software development studio. The first product, of course, is to restore "Daily Money", which the author has been using for over a decade. After all, there are still many users who have been using it since the first version, and the author is grateful for their support.

## Daily Money One

`Daily Money One` is an easy-to-use accounting application based on simple accounting concepts. It features a simple user interface, no fancy designs, and no gamified content, designed solely for users to focus on accounting easily. In addition to being suitable for personal and household accounting, it is also suitable for the accounting needs of small businesses. In the future, we will introduce more features tailored to the accounting needs of households and small businesses to provide more comprehensive services.

`About Ads`: In order to ensure that the author's two cats have food and the author has coffee to drink, and to ensure the continued maintenance and operation of this program, advertisements have been added. Currently, there are two levels of ad settings available for users to adjust, and adjustments will also be made based on user numbers in the future. The author's starting point is still to ensure that ads do not affect the user experience. You can adjust the ad settings by going to "Preferences > Advertisement Settings" after installation.
