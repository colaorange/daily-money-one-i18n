## What's New

### In 1.0.0-beta

In addition to replicating 90% of the original daily ledger + functions, starting from version 1.0, the following new features have been added:

> * One-to-many split transactions
> * Transfer between Account Books
> * Quick view of balance sheet and charts

## One-to-Many Splitting

Sometimes, a single expense may involve multiple categories of expenditure. For example, when shopping at a supermarket, you may purchase food, daily necessities, and electronic products at once. To cope with this situation, the application provides advanced transaction creation editing, allowing a single expense to be allocated to multiple different expenditure categories. In other words, you can allocate the amount of a single credit card swipe expense to multiple categories such as food, daily necessities, and electronic products. Please note: In transactions within the same account book, because the currency units are equal, the total amount transferred out must be equal to the total amount transferred in, otherwise the program will reject your transaction creation.

## Transfer between Account Books

The program allows you to transfer between accounts in different account books. Whether in the basic or advanced transaction editing or creation screen, you can select accounts from other account books when selecting accounts. Since the currency values between different account books may differ, and the exchange rate is not fixed at the moment, such as transferring from New Taiwan Dollars to US Dollars, the program will not limit you to create a transaction where the total amount transferred out must be equal to the total amount transferred in. Please create transactions based on the actual amounts when creating and be careful.

## Quick View of Balance Sheet and Charts

When browsing the balance sheet or charts, you can add specific account items to the quick view to the home screen [*1]. Simply swipe right on the item in the balance sheet and click `Add to Quick View`, or click "Add to Quick View Icon" at the upper right corner of the balance chart card. Next, on the homepage, you'll see the balance of assets and liabilities for that item, or you can view it on the chart page of the home screen. Additionally, you can sort or remove these items in `Preferences > Home Screen Settings`.

[*1] Excessive quick views on the home screen may affect the loading time of the home screen.
